# CS50x Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my CS50x Problem Set Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions for the weekly problem sets from Week 1 to Week 10 for Harvard University's CS50x course. CS50x is an introduction to computer science and the art of programming, and these solutions represent my efforts in mastering the concepts taught in the course.

## Repository Contents

- **Week 1 to Week 10 Solutions:** Each folder corresponds to a specific week's problem set. Inside each folder, you will find my solutions to the respective problem set challenges.

## How to Navigate

1. **Browse Weekly Problem Sets:** Navigate to the specific week's folder you're interested in.
2. **Explore Solutions:** Inside each week's folder, you'll find the solutions to individual problem set questions. The code files are named descriptively to help you understand their purpose.

Feel free to explore, learn, and even provide feedback or improvements if you find ways to optimize the solutions. Remember that these solutions are one way to approach the problems, and there might be multiple valid solutions.

## How to Use

If you're a CS50x student or someone learning computer science, you can use these solutions as a reference or a guide to understanding various problem-solving techniques. However, I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before exploring the solutions. Learning through problem-solving is a valuable skill in programming.

## Contribution

If you find any issues with the solutions or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. I welcome contributions and collaboration to make these solutions more comprehensive and helpful for the community.

Thank you for visiting my CS50x Problem Set Solutions repository! Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
